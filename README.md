# Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization

This repository contains my project from Accenture North America's Data Analytics and Visualization program on Forage. The project involves advising a hypothetical social media client as a Data Analyst at Accenture.

## Project Overview

In this project, I:
- Advised a hypothetical social media client
- Cleaned, modeled, and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover insights into content trends
- Prepared a PowerPoint deck and video presentation to communicate key insights for the client and internal stakeholders
